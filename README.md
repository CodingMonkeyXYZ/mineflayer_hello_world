# mineflayer_hello_world
My first Mineflayer bot for CivCraft. Doesn't do much except sit there, echo chat and pms and send a pm to you if you walk into a snitch that the bot is on. It also runs /jalist - the output of which you can see in the console.

This bot could easily be adapted to be an auto-logging AFK bot or snitch network bot (or both). Have fun...

run with:

node echo.js --host mc.civcraft.vg --port 25565 --username %your_username% --password %your_password%

I recomend using environment variables to store the username and password. Obviously on linux you leave out the %% around the environment variables.
